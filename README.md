# wamp-routers

This repository shows simple examples how to implement WAMP routers using different libraries.

In the article [Web Application Messaging Protocol](https://blog.felix-seifert.com/web-application-messaging-protocol/) is described how several entities communicate via WAMP.

The repository [wamp-clients](https://github.com/felix-seifert/wamp-clients) shows how to implement clients using different libraries.

Till now, this repository includes following examples:
* [wamp2spring-routeronly](https://github.com/felix-seifert/wamp-routers/tree/master/wamp2spring-routeronly) (router without procedures and publications)
* [wamp2spring-pubsub-rpc](https://github.com/felix-seifert/wamp-routers/tree/master/wamp2spring-pubsub-rpc) (registering a procedure and publishing on a topic)
